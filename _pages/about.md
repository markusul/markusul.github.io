I am a PhD student at the [Seminar for Statistics at ETH Zürich](https://math.ethz.ch/sfs), supervised by
[Prof. Peter Bühlmann](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~peterbu/). My research interests include statistical machine learning, causal inference, and distributional robustness.

I used to work as a research assistant at the [Institute of Data Analysis and Process Design at ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/idp). There I mainly worked on machine health and predictive maintenance with [Dr. Lilach Goren Huber](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/gorn).
